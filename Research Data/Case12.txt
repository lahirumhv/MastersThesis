---RESPONSE_START---

Rotorua generally has good air quality, but there are a few factors to consider:

Overall Air Quality: Generally good with occasional impacts from geothermal activity.

**4. Indoor Air Quality
Accommodation: Most accommodations in Rotorua maintain good indoor air quality, but if you have specific sensitivities, consider staying in places with good ventilation.
