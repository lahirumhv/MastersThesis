i like to travel by cabs mostly. can u update the costs?


---RESPONSE_START---

Since you prefer to travel by cabs, here’s an updated cost estimate considering taxi travel during your trip.

Updated Budget Breakdown (Approximate):
Accommodation:
300–450 NZD (for 3 nights in a budget stay).

Meals:
50–70 NZD per day (150–210 NZD for 3 days).

Cab Costs:
Auckland to Rotorua (One-way taxi): Around 450–600 NZD depending on service.
Round trip: 900–1200 NZD.

This means you would likely exceed the 2000 NZD budget if you travel entirely by cab, particularly due to the high cost of a taxi between Auckland and Rotorua. To stay within your budget, you might consider taking a bus (which costs around 50–70 NZD each way) for the Auckland to Rotorua leg and using cabs locally in Rotorua, which would save significant costs.
