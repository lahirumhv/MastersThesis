---PROMPT_START---

I am 34 year old woman currently living in Aukland. I am planning to go on vacation Rotorua area on my 5 day annual leaves with my husband. I havent finalized an exact date. What is the best period to travel to Rotorua area?

---RESPONSE_START---

The best time to visit Rotorua depends on what you want to experience. Rotorua offers attractions year-round, but here are some factors to consider:

Spring (September to November):

Pleasant weather, with blooming gardens and fewer crowds.
Great for outdoor activities like hiking and exploring geothermal areas.
Summer (December to February):

Warmest temperatures (average highs of 23°C), ideal for water-based activities like lake cruises and visiting hot springs.
It's the busiest tourist season, so expect more crowds.
Autumn (March to May):

Mild weather and stunning autumn foliage.
Fewer tourists compared to summer, so a great time for sightseeing without the rush.
Winter (June to August):

Cooler, with highs around 12-15°C. You can enjoy hot springs and geothermal parks comfortably.
Off-peak season means better accommodation rates and fewer tourists.
For a balance of good weather and fewer crowds, spring or autumn might be ideal for your trip.

I cant go on longer hikes due to a medical condition.. but a total hike about 2 hours is fine. does rainbow mountain summit hike take longer?

---RESPONSE_START---

The Rainbow Mountain Summit Hike takes about 2 to 2.5 hours round trip, depending on your pace. The trail is a moderate uphill climb, covering 5.5 km in total (return), so it might be slightly over your 2-hour limit if done at a relaxed pace. However, you can shorten the hike by stopping at the lookout point about halfway up, which still offers beautiful views and takes about 1 hour to reach (return).

If you'd prefer a shorter alternative, consider Okere Falls Track or Lake Tikitapu (Blue Lake) Track, which are both scenic and within your time limit.
