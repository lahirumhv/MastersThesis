Think of yourself as an expert travel adviser. Help me plan a trip to Rotorua from Auckland with a budget of NZD 2000. The budget should cover all aspects of the trip including transportation, accommodation, food costs and activities.

---RESPONSE_START---

Let's break down your Rotorua trip with a budget of NZD 2000, covering transportation, accommodation, food, and activities. Here's a detailed plan, assuming a 3-day trip from Auckland, with 4 adults traveling in your own car.

1. Transportation: Car Costs
Since you‚Äôre driving your own car, we‚Äôll need to budget for fuel and any necessary car maintenance or tolls.

Fuel: Auckland to Rotorua is approximately 230 km (one way). Assuming fuel consumption of 8 liters/100 km and a fuel price of NZD 2.30 per liter:

Round trip fuel cost: NZD 85.

Car Insurance / Maintenance: If your car is well-maintained, you might not need extra costs, but budgeting for unexpected repairs or insurance coverage might be wise. Approx: NZD 20.

Total transportation cost: NZD 105.

2. Accommodation (3 nights)
Since you plan to stay in Rotorua for three days, accommodation will be a key portion of your budget. There are several options in Rotorua, but let‚Äôs aim for something affordable and comfortable.

Budget option: Motels, Airbnbs, or campgrounds.
Motels (3-star or 4-star) in Rotorua typically range from NZD 120‚Äì160 per night for a group of 4 adults. This may vary depending on availability and time of booking.
For 3 nights at NZD 140 per night (on average):
Accommodation cost: NZD 420.
3. Food Costs
You‚Äôve mentioned planning to prepare breakfast and lunch, and sandwiches for dinner on day one. So, let‚Äôs break down the food costs accordingly.

Groceries: For breakfast, lunch, and dinner on day one, plus snacks, budget around NZD 50‚Äì70 for groceries.

Groceries: NZD 60 (for day 1).
Dining out: For days 2 and 3, you might want to dine out for lunch and dinner.

Average cost for a meal at a mid-range restaurant: NZD 20‚Äì30 per person.
Two meals per day for 4 adults:
Lunch = NZD 25/person √ó 4 = NZD 100.
Dinner = NZD 30/person √ó 4 = NZD 120.
For 2 days: NZD 220 for meals.
Total food cost:
Groceries (Day 1) = NZD 60 + Meals (Day 2 and 3) = NZD 220 = NZD 280.

4. Activities & Attractions
Rotorua is known for its geothermal wonders, adventure activities, and cultural experiences. Since you want fun activities without a MƒÅori village visit, here are some suggestions:

The Buried Village of Te Wairoa: Entry fee is around NZD 30 per adult.

Total cost for 4 adults: NZD 120.
Rotorua‚Äôs Geothermal Parks (e.g., Wai-O-Tapu, Hell‚Äôs Gate, or Te Puia):

Entry fee is around NZD 40 per adult for parks like Wai-O-Tapu.
Total for 4 adults: NZD 160.
Other fun activities:

Agrodome Farm Show: NZD 40 per adult.
Skyline Gondola: NZD 45 per adult.
You might choose one or two of these activities, budgeting around NZD 200 total for extra activities.
Total activities cost: Around NZD 500 for all activities.

5. Total Budget Breakdown
Transportation: NZD 105
Accommodation: NZD 420
Food: NZD 280
Activities: NZD 500
Total estimated cost:
NZD 1305

Remaining Budget: NZD 695
This leftover amount can be used for any additional expenses such as souvenirs, extra activities, or emergencies. You also have flexibility for upgrading accommodations or dining experiences, if desired.
