---PROMPT_START---

How long is the distance from Auckland to Rotorua?

---RESPONSE_START---

The distance from Auckland to Rotorua is approximately 230 kilometers (143 miles) by road. The drive typically takes around 2.5 to 3 hours, depending on traffic and road conditions. The route follows State Highway 1 (SH1) and State Highway 5 (SH5), offering scenic views along the way.

---END_OF_PAIR---



---PROMPT_START---

Is 100$ sufficient for fuel for travelling by car? To visit all places and return to Auckland?

---RESPONSE_START---


Yes, 100 NZD should be sufficient for fuel for your trip from Auckland to Rotorua and back, including visits to local attractions, depending on your car's fuel efficiency.

Here's a rough breakdown:
Auckland to Rotorua (round trip): 460 kilometers (230 km each way).
Driving within Rotorua: Expect an additional ~100-150 km over three days for local travel to nearby attractions.
That totals around 600-650 kilometers for the entire trip.

Fuel Calculation:
If your car consumes 8 liters per 100 km (average fuel consumption for mid-sized cars):
You’ll need around 48-52 liters of fuel for the entire trip.
At a current average fuel price of 2.60 NZD per liter, this would cost approximately 125-135 NZD.
If your car has better fuel efficiency (e.g., 6-7 liters per 100 km), 100 NZD might cover it, but for most cars, it's safer to budget around 125-150 NZD for fuel.
