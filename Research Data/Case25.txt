Several companies, such as Super Shuttle and Rotorua Airport Shuttles, operate on-demand shared shuttle services to popular attractions and the airport.
3. Rotorua Public Bus (BayBus)
Cost:
$2.80 NZD per adult per ride (using a preloaded Bee Card)
$3.50 NZD per adult if paying cash

You can buy a Bee Card for $5 and top it up for cheaper rides.
4. Taxi or Rideshare (Uber)
Cost:
Short city trips: $15–25 NZD
Longer trips (e.g., Waikite Valley): $50–100 NZD each way
Details:
Rotorua has a few local taxi services like Rotorua Taxis, and Uber operates in the city as well.
Taxis are reliable for short trips within the city but can be expensive for long-distance travel to geothermal areas or lakes.
5. Organized Tours & Day Trips
Cost:
$100–200 NZD per person, depending on the tour and inclusions (often includes transportation, entry fees, and a guide).
Details:
Many tour companies offer package tours to key attractions like Wai-O-Tapu, Hobbiton, and Waitomo Caves. These often include round-trip transportation, which can save you the hassle of driving.

For your trip, I’d recommend renting a car for flexibility, especially if you’re visiting places like Waikite Valley and Waimangu Volcanic Valley, which are further from the city. If you're staying mostly within Rotorua, public transport, taxis, or shuttles can be more economical.
